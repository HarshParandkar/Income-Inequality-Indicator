# Gini Index Predictor

## Overview

This project provides a web application that predicts the Gini Index based on socio-economic indicators. The model is built using various regression techniques and deployed via a Flask web application.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `income_inequality_indicator_2_0.py` - Contains the model building code.
- `index.html`: HTML form for user input.
- `dataset.xlsx`: Dataset for the model. Follow this link to download it - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10G_CVXG9qV3GztIFQ0WDGniIP4uIaoMT/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101673839528144597155&rtpof=true&sd=true
- `best_model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model. Follow this link to download the pickle file. - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQ4ZJhtlGrt9q5zxEebuAeCbYTK7gjQC/view?usp=drive_link

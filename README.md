# Gini Index Predictor

## Overview

This project provides a web application that predicts the Gini Index based on socio-economic indicators. The model is built using various regression techniques and deployed via a Flask web application.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `index.html`: HTML form for user input.
- `best_model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Install Dependencies using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'**
3. **Run the Flask App using 'python app.py**
4. **Access the Web Application: Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the Gini Index Predictor web application.**

## Usage
- Enter the required socio-economic indicators into the form fields.
- Click the "Predict" button to get the Gini Index prediction.
## Features
- Input socio-economic data through a web form.
- Predict Gini Index using the trained model.
## Model Details
- Model Type: Random Forest Regressor
- Performance Metrics: Mean Squared Error, R2 Score
